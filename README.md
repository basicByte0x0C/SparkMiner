# SparkMiner v2.6.0

**High-performance dual-core Bitcoin solo miner for ESP32**

<img src="images/1767589853452.jpg" alt="SparkMiner Display" width="575">

SparkMiner is optimized firmware for the ESP32-2432S028 "Cheap Yellow Display" (CYD) board, delivering ~700 KH/s using hardware-accelerated SHA-256 and a pipelined assembly mining loop.

> **Solo Mining Disclaimer:** Solo mining on an ESP32 is a lottery. The odds of finding a block are astronomically low (~1 in 10^20 per hash at current difficulty). This project is for education, fun, and supporting network decentralization - not profit.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Launcher + SD Card (Recommended for CYD Boards)

The easiest way to install and manage SparkMiner on CYD boards (1-USB or 2-USB variants):

**Step 1: Flash the Launcher (one-time)**
1. Go to [Bruce Launcher Web Flasher](https://bmorcelli.github.io/Launcher/webflasher.html)
2. Connect your CYD board via USB
3. Select your board type and click **Install**
4. The Launcher provides a boot menu for multiple firmwares

**Step 2: Prepare SD Card**
1. Format a microSD card as **FAT32**
2. Download `esp32-2432s028-2usb_firmware.bin` (or your board variant) from [Releases](https://github.com/SneezeGUI/SparkMiner/releases)
3. Copy the `.bin` file to the SD card root
4. Create a `config.json` file (see Configuration section)
5. Insert SD card into CYD

**Step 3: Boot SparkMiner**
1. Power on the CYD - the Launcher menu appears
2. Select SparkMiner firmware from the SD card
3. SparkMiner loads your config and starts mining!

**Why use the Launcher?**
- Easy firmware updates - just replace the `.bin` on SD card
- Switch between multiple firmwares
- No need to re-flash via USB for updates
- Config persists on SD card

### Option 2: Direct USB Flashing

1. Download the latest `*_factory.bin` firmware from [Releases](https://github.com/SneezeGUI/SparkMiner/releases)
2. Flash using [ESP Web Flasher](https://esp.huhn.me/) or esptool:
   ```bash
   esptool.py --chip esp32 --port COM3 write_flash 0x0 esp32-2432s028-2usb_factory.bin
   ```
3. Power on the board - it will create a WiFi access point
4. Connect to `SparkMiner-XXXX` WiFi and configure via the web portal

### Option 3: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/SneezeGUI/SparkMiner.git
cd SparkMiner

# Install PlatformIO CLI (if not installed)
pip install platformio

# Build and flash (auto-detects USB port)
pio run -e esp32-2432s028-2usb -t upload

# Monitor serial output
pio device monitor
```

## Firmware Types

Understanding the difference between the firmware files:

- **`*_firmware.bin`**: The application only. Use this for **Launcher/SD card updates** or OTA updates. It does not include the bootloader.
- **`*_factory.bin`**: The complete image (Bootloader + Partition Table + App). Use this for **direct USB flashing** (Option 2) to a blank board or to restore a board.

Create a `config.json` file on a FAT32-formatted microSD card:

```json
{
  "ssid": "YourWiFiName",
  "wifi_password": "YourWiFiPassword",
  "pool_url": "public-pool.io",
  "pool_port": 21496,
  "wallet": "bc1qYourBitcoinAddressHere",
  "worker_name": "SparkMiner-1",
  "pool_password": "x",
  "brightness": 100
}
```

## Performance

### Expected Hashrates

| Board | Hashrate | Power | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|-------|
| ESP32-2432S028 (CYD) | ~700 KH/s | ~0.5W | With display |
| ESP32-S3 | ~800 KH/s | ~0.4W | No display overhead |
| ESP32 Headless | ~750 KH/s | ~0.3W | Serial only |

### Architecture

SparkMiner uses both ESP32 cores efficiently:

- **Core 1 (High Priority):** Pipelined hardware SHA-256 mining using direct register access
- **Core 0 (Low Priority):** WiFi, Stratum protocol, display, and software SHA-256 mining

This dual-core approach maximizes hashrate while maintaining responsive UI and network connectivity.

## Troubleshooting

### WiFi Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Won't connect to WiFi | Check SSID/password, ensure 2.4GHz network (not 5GHz) |
| Keeps disconnecting | Move closer to router, check for interference |
| AP mode not appearing | Hold BOOT 5s at power-on, or long-press during operation |

### Display Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| White/blank screen | Try `esp32-2432s028-st7789` environment |
| Inverted colors | Triple-click to toggle, or set `invert_colors` in config.json |
| Flickering | Reduce SPI frequency in platformio.ini |

### Mining Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| 0 H/s hashrate | Check pool connection, verify wallet address |
| Shares rejected | Check wallet address format, pool may be down |
| High reject rate | Network latency issue, try different pool |
| "SHA-PIPE WARNING" | Normal during HTTPS requests, doesn't affect mining |

### Serial Debug

Connect via USB and monitor at 115200 baud:

## FAQ

**Q: Will I actually mine a Bitcoin block?**

A: Extremely unlikely. At ~700 KH/s vs network ~500 EH/s, your odds per block are about 1 in 10^15. It's like winning the lottery multiple times. But someone has to mine blocks, and it could theoretically be you!

**Q: How much electricity does it use?**

A: About 0.5W, or ~4.4 kWh per year (~$0.50-1.00/year in electricity).

**Q: Can I mine other cryptocurrencies?**

A: No, SparkMiner only supports Bitcoin (SHA-256d). Other coins use different algorithms.

**Q: Why is my hashrate lower than expected?**

A: Display updates, WiFi activity, and live stats fetching briefly reduce hashrate. The EMA-smoothed display shows average performance.

**Q: Do I need an SD card?**

A: No, you can configure via the WiFi portal. SD card is just more convenient for headless setup.

**Q: Can I use this with a mining pool that pays regularly?**

A: Yes, but solo pools like Public Pool only pay if YOU find a block. For regular payouts, use a traditional pool, but the amounts will be negligible.
