## Features

- **Dual-Core Mining:** Utilizes both ESP32 cores for maximum throughput.
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Uses the ESP32's SHA-256 hardware accelerator via direct register access.
- **Pipelined Assembly:** Core 1 runs a highly optimized pipelined assembly mining loop.
- **Visual Interface:** Beautiful UI on the 2.8" TFT display showing hashrate, difficulty, and network stats.
- **Stratum V1 Support:** Compatible with standard pools (Public-Pool, CKPool, etc.).
- **Live Monitoring:** Real-time tracking of:
  - Hashrate (Instant & Average)
  - Pool Latency (Ping)
  - Device Temperature
  - Network Difficulty & Block Height

## Hardware Requirements

- **Board:** ESP32-2432S028R (CYD - Cheap Yellow Display)
- **USB Cables:** 2x USB cables (if using the 2-USB version for power stability)

## Architecture

- **Core 0:** Runs WiFi, Stratum protocol, Display updates, and a secondary Software SHA-256 miner.
- **Core 1:** Dedicated to the high-performance Pipelined Hardware SHA-256 miner.

## Configuration

Configuration is loaded from `config.json` on the SD card (if present) or via the WiFi Access Point portal on first boot.
